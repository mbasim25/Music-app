# Music-App
A simple design heavy app where people can search for artists, songs, and view top songs of the week.


I saw a really cool design for a music app while learning tailwind so i decided to recreate it from scratch, after finishing the design i decided to use deezer's api to fetch some data its a simple app that only focuses on responsive design patterns and axios.
